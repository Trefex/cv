abstract = {Abstract Objective Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), which has been reported not to be restricted to striatal neurons. However, studies that analyzed mitochondrial function at the level of selected enzymatic activities in peripheral tissues have produced conflicting data. We considered the electron transport chain as a complex system with mitochondrial membrane potential as an integrative indicator for mitochondrial fitness. Methods Twenty-five IPD patients (nine females; mean disease duration, 6.2 years) and 16 healthy age-matched controls (12 females) were recruited. Live platelets were purified using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and single-cell data on mitochondrial membrane potential (∆ψ) were measured by cytometry and challenged with a protonophore agent. Results Functional mitochondrial membrane potential was detected in all participants. The challenge test reduced the membrane potential in all IPD patients and controls (P < 0.001). However, the response to the challenge was not significantly different between patients and controls. Interpretation While the reported protonophore challenge assay is a valid marker of overall mitochondrial function in live platelets, intact mitochondrial membrane potential in platelets derived from IPD patients suggests that presumed mitochondrial enzymatic deficiencies are compensable in this cell type. In consequence, mitochondrial membrane potential in platelets cannot be used as a diagnostic biomarker for nonstratified IPD but should be further explored in potential Parkinson's disease subtypes and tissues with higher energy demands.},

abstract = {Biological systems present multiple scales of complexity, ranging from molecules to entire populations. Light microscopy is one of the least invasive techniques used to access information from various biological scales in living cells. The combination of molecular biology and imaging provides a bottom-up tool for direct insight into how molecular processes work on a cellular scale. However, imaging can also be used as a top-down approach to study the behavior of a system without detailed prior knowledge about its underlying molecular mechanisms. In this review, we highlight the recent developments on microscopy-based systems analyses and discuss the complementary opportunities and different challenges with high-content screening and high-throughput imaging. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of the available platforms that can be used for image analysis, which enable community-driven efforts in the development of image-based systems biology.},

This map integrates pathways implicated in PD pathogenesis such as synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired protein degradation, alpha-synuclein pathobiology and neuroinflammation.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, is a commonly used cell line in studies related to neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and neurodegenerative diseases. Although this cell line is often used as a cellular model for Parkinson's disease, the relevance of this cellular model in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative diseases has not yet been systematically evaluated. RESULTS: We have used a systems genomics approach to characterize the SH-SY5Y cell line using whole-genome sequencing to determine the genetic content of the cell line and used transcriptomics and proteomics data to determine molecular correlations. Further, we integrated genomic variants using a network analysis approach to evaluate the suitability of the SH-SY5Y cell line for perturbation experiments in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. CONCLUSIONS: The systems genomics approach showed consistency across different biological levels (DNA, RNA and protein concentrations). Most of the genes belonging to the major Parkinson's disease pathways and modules were intact in the SH-SY5Y genome. Specifically, each analysed gene related to PD has at least one intact copy in SH-SY5Y. The disease-specific network analysis approach ranked the genetic integrity of SH-SY5Y as higher for PD than for Alzheimer's disease but lower than for Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis for loss of function perturbation experiments.},

abstract = {Modern communication networks are reaching a high level of complexity. As their global dimensioning and performance evaluation are very hard tasks, a multi-layer approach is generally applied to divide them in smaller problems easier to tackle. Within this approach, tools only address one or two network layers. To perform an enhanced analysis encompassing more layers, several tools, not necessarily available in the same place when the problem arises, are often required. This paper shows how to allow a remote access to various existing tools using Web Services paradigm. In this way, software components modelling network elements, layers, or computing specific functions are turned into Web Services, which are available to remote users over the internet. Accessed through a simplified interface, they can be used sequentially or in parallel to solve a specific task. This dispenses the user to perform a local implementation, allows better code reuse, and offers an easy way to confront results from distinct models. A tool accessed via a web service can be beneficial for either research or educational purposes. Moreover, making tools available on the web increases credibility and visibility of their authors. Calls to Web Service require transmitting and retrieving all input and output data in a specific format. In our approach, the Multilayer Network Description (MND) format is used to describe both input data and computed results. It offers common basic structure while guaranteeing a large extensibility, and thus eases the interactions between related but different tools. The viability of this approach in the context of network planning is illustrated through two examples.},

abstract = {Abstract Although very developed in many sectors (databases, filesystems), access control schemes are still somewhat elusive when it comes to wireless sensor net- works. However, it is clear that many WSN systems—such as healthcare and automotive ones—need a controlled access to data that sensor nodes produce, given its high sensitivity. Enforcing access control in wireless sensor networks is a particularly difficult task due to the limited computational capacity of wireless sensor nodes. In this paper we present a full-fledged access control scheme for wireless sensor data. We enforce access control through data encryption, thus embedding access control in sensor data units. We also propose a lightweight key generation mechanism, based on cryptographic hash functions, that allows for hierarchical key derivation. The suggested pro- tocol only relies on simple operations, does not require interactions between nodes and data consumers and has minimal storage requirements.},

In this study, we present an optimized neuronal differentiation protocol for SH-SY5Y that requires only two work steps and 6 days. After differentiation, the cells present increased levels of ATP and plasma membrane activity but reduced expression of energetic stress response genes. Differentiation results in reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased robustness toward perturbations with 6-hydroxydopamine.

In this article, we present an analytical service that works in tandem with a visualization library to address these problems.Using a combination of existing technologies and a platform-specific data abstraction layer, we developed a service that is capable of providing existing web-based data warehouses and repositories with platform-independent visual analytical capabilities. The design of this service also allows for federated data analysis by eliminating the need to move the data directly to the researcher. Instead, all operations are based on statistics and interactive charts without direct access to the dataset.The software presented in this article has a potential to help translational researchers achieve a better understanding of a given dataset and quickly generate new hypotheses.
